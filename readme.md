# gameshell-mac

*A basic shell for mac-based OpenGL games.*

This is meant to act as a starting point for mac-based OpenGL games.
It is designed to work will with the (so far unreleased)
companion repo *gameshell-win*.

This is a low-level game shell. It includes:

* A basic vertex / fragment shader pair.
* Placeholder functions for initializing and running a render cycle.
* Placeholder functions for working with user input.
* The GLM math library to easily work with vectors and matrices.
* The `oswrap` library to provide a cross-platform interface for common game operations.

To use it, just download and modify to your heart's content. You're
free to release and sell - or give away - what you make with it.
